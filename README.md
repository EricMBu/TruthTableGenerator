# TruthTableGenerator
This is an app I made to help with solving logic problems and to practice coding in JS. 

To install, just clone the repository and open "index.html" in the web browser of your choosing.

Important: As of 2023-01-12, there is a bug causing the 'implies' operator to have the lowest precedence, as opposed to second lowest. This can be mitigated by using parantheses to specify the order in which the expression should be evalutated. I will try to fix this in a future release.
